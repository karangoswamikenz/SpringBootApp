# SpringBootApp
Go and build a simple Spring Boot microservice that takes in HTTP requests (via REST) and persists them to persistent storage.

This is a classic microservice and you will cover a lot of ground:

* SOLID principles

* Inversion of Control/Event driven

* Composition vs Inheritence

* DAO implementation (JPA/JDBC/take your pick!)

* Transactions

* Idempotency and REST

* Controller/Service/Repo layers

* Unit tests

I say to use Spring Boot to do this because it abstract a lot of the implementation away and allows you to focus on coming up to speed with enterprise design patterns and architecture.
